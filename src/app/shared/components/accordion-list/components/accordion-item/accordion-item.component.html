      The first, characters are read from the input file and assigned a category
      code (sometimes called "catcode", for short). Combinations of a backslash
      (actually, any character of category zero) followed by letters (characters
      of category 11) or a single other character are replaced by a
      control-sequence token. In this sense, this stage is like lexical
      analysis, although it does not form numbers from digits. In the next
      stage, expandable control sequences (such as conditionals or defined
      macros) are replaced by their replacement text. The input for the third
      stage is then a stream of characters (including the ones with special
      meaning) and unexpandable control sequences (typically assignments and
      visual commands). Here, the characters get assembled into a paragraph, and
      TeX's paragraph breaking algorithm works by optimizing breakpoints over
      the whole paragraph.
